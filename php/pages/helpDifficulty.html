		<h1>Help : the difficulty</h1>
		<p>
		The difficulty of the challenge determines the number of challenge points won when completed
		(the more difficult a challenge is, the more points it gives).
		It is therefore important to choose it carefully.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is an approximate scale of reference for the difficulty. Try to abide by it for your challenge.
			<ul>
				<li>A challenge <span class="challenges-item-difficulty-0">easy</span> has to be feasible for a beginner (&quot;Complete Mario Circuit 1 in Time Trial in less than 55s&quot;)</li>
				<li>A challenge <span class="challenges-item-difficulty-1">medium</span> is typically difficult for a beginner but easy for an experimented player (&quot;Complete Mario Circuit 1 in TT in less than 45s&quot;)</li>
				<li>A challenge <span class="challenges-item-difficulty-2">difficult</span> would be difficult for an experimented player but completable in several trials (&quot;Complete Mario Circuit 1 in TT in less than 39s&quot;)</li>
				<li>A challenge <span class="challenges-item-difficulty-3">extreme</span> will require to try-hard even for an experimented player (&quot;Complete Mario Circuit 1 in TT in less than 38s&quot;)</li>
				<li>A challenge <span class="challenges-item-difficulty-4">impossible</span> will require to try-hard and may typically take several hours (or even days) before succeeding (&quot;Complete Mario Circuit 1 in TT in less than 37s&quot;)</li>
			</ul>
