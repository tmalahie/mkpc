		<h1>Challenge difficulties</h1>
		<p>
		A challenge's difficulty determines the number of points earned when completed
		(the more difficult a challenge is, the more points earned).
		It is therefore important to choose it carefully.
		</p>
		<p>
		Here is an approximate difficulty scale for reference. Try to stick to it for your challenges.
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>An <span class="challenges-item-difficulty-0">easy</span> challenge has to be doable for an absolute beginner.</li>
				<li>A <span class="challenges-item-difficulty-1">medium</span> challenge is typically difficult for a beginner but easy for an experimented player.</li>
				<li>A <span class="challenges-item-difficulty-2">difficult</span> challenge would be challenging for an experimented player but doable in several trials.</li>
				<li>An <span class="challenges-item-difficulty-3">extreme</span> challenge will require an experimented player to try-hard.</li>
				<li>An <span class="challenges-item-difficulty-4">impossible</span> challenge will require experimented players to try for several hours, or even days before succeeding.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		Note that challenges are moderated before publication, so you have no interest over-evaluating the difficulty of your challenges.
